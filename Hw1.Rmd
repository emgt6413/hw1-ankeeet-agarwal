## Ans 6.  
Of the 9 circles of scientific hell, I feel **overselling** seems to be the hardest to avoid. A scientific finding that may have taken intense efforts, may not always be a life-enhancing. However a researcher may believe that a high effort research is high impact too. This perception could make a scientist strenuously persuade publishers to give attention to their work. The second reason why overselling is hard to avoid is the media's love for publishing sensational scientific findings. This may encourage scientist to apply their findings to questionable fields in the hope of garnering accolades. The final reason could be the academic culture of 'publish or perish', scientists overwhelmingly feel the need to remain relevant.
